	<p> Video shows how the story runs successfully; highlights are if a number is not included the program ends with a witty line.
	Also highlights the restart from previous decision so it is not as frustrating! Runs successfully with a plot and many decisions</p>
	
    <p> The development process was extremely fun.The incremental design was including functions that had background 
    print command text and then an input decision after with an if statement if it was in parameters and if to continue
    or to end program; and it got interesting when I added in a command if not listed in choices the program would end which was a difficulty. 
    Next we called the previous function to restart game incase decision was wrong which was an interesting turn; which was another difficulty
    as it added something that made the program feel more alive and more complete. The restarting and not included was independent;
    the story creation was independent, the collaboration was the input decisions and prints that my partner did</p>
